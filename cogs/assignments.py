'''
This cog will check for assignments due in the next x days for each user every x hours.
If there are any assignments due in the next x days, the user will be messaged with the assignments via discord DM.

This cog requires the stud_util cog to be loaded as it uses the get_user_canvas function to get the users API key.

This cog requires a users.json file to be present in the same directory as the bot. The users.json file should have the following format:

Example users.json:
{
    "users": [
        {
            "snowflake": "1234567890",
            "canvas": "encrypted_api_key"
        },
    ]
}

The users.json file should contain a list of users with their snowflake id and encrypted canvas api key.

The Canvas API URL is set to Temple University's Canvas API URL. This can be changed to any other Canvas API URL.

note: When in development mode, if you keyboardInterrupt (Ex: cntrl + c) the bot, their will be an error dump for now. 
    This is normal and will be fixed in the future.
